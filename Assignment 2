# Assignment 2 Unchanged Function 

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}
myMean(assignment2)

# Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found

# Explanation
# This function fails because the name assignment and someData do not exist. 
# In the first line of our function, we called the variable to be used in the function 'assignment2'. 
# For the code to work, we need to change 'assignment' and 'someData' to 'assignment2', then the code will work. 

# Corrected code

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}
myMean(assignment2)

# Result: [1] 19.25

# To check

mean(assignment2)

# Result: [1] 19.25
